# Pentagonal Number

Write a function that takes a positive integer `num` and calculates how many dots exist in a pentagonal shape around the center dot on the _Nth_ iteration.

In the image below you can see the first iteration is only a single dot. On the second, there are 6 dots. On the third, there are 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots.
